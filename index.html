    <h3>HTML</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Stands for HyperText Markup Language</li>
      <li>Building block of the web</li>
      <li>Provides the basic skeleton of all websites</li>
      <li>What you can see, view and click on</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>CSS</h3>
    <p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets and is all about <em>STYLE!</em><span style="color: #256edb; font-size: 24px;"> For example, this sentence has an inline style; I've increased the font size to 24 px and changed the font color to blue!</span> Pretty cool, huh?!</p>
